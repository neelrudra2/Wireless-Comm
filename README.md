<h1>Wireless Modem Simulation</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Wireless Modem Simulation Project is a comprehensive simulation tool designed to model and demonstrate the behavior of different wireless modems, including CDMA, GSM, UMTS, and LTE. This project simulates real-time data transmission and reception using these modem technologies, providing insights into their functionalities and data handling mechanisms.

<h2>Features</h2>
1. Modular Design: The simulation is structured with a base class WirelessModem and derived classes for CDMA, GSM, UMTS, and LTE. This modular approach ensures that each modem type can be configured and tested independently.</br>
2. Real-Time Data Simulation: Incorporates real-time data generation to mimic actual data transmission scenarios. The simulation includes basic encoding and decoding to illustrate data handling processes.</br>
3. Protocol Handling: Implements basic protocol features such as encoding/decoding to simulate real-world modem behavior.</br>
4. Error Handling: Includes simple error handling for data encoding and decoding to demonstrate error management in wireless communication.
